st - simple terminal

chiller fork
------------

I use gnome terminal in dark mode as a daily driver.
The ux of switching dark to light mode is so bad that I decided to
create a st fork just to have a light mode terminal.
Quitting gnome and booting st is much smoother than clicking in
the HORRIBLE gnome settings.
